                <p class="lead">A significant portion of the first term has been spent on extensive research. The area of bots and digital assistants is relatively new when we consider the tools available to the public to build these. The project itself has a very specific aim when we consider the way the user interacts with the product as well as which platforms it will be best to implement on. As a result the team has done a lot of research to make the most informed decision to produce the best end product we can. </p>

                                        <li>Android -   Select the Recents tab, tap the floating action button, and then tap the bot icon. Alternatively, you can find available bots in your Contacts.</li>

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">Some bots will be certified by Skype to show its authenticity, you can normally tell is authentic by because of three things.</p>
                                    </br><center><img src="img/skypecertified.png"></center></br>

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">You can block or remove a bot the same way you would a regular Skype contact. Get help with blocking or removing a contact. If you want to report feedback on a specific bot, contact the bot developer directly. You'll find the name of the developer in the 'created by' section of the bot's profile.</p>
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">You can also have group chats with bots for those that have that feature enabled.</p>
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">Most Skype bots can be found in the Skype Directory however there also also certain bots that cannot be found here and must instead be added via their link - the link just directs you to a webpage which will let you add the specified bot as contact to your account.</p>

                                <h4 class="lead">Similar apps to our project:</h4>
                                <p style="padding-left: 20px">Since using Skype for our bot seemed very promising, we decided to see if there were any bots which would be performing a similar task so we would have a better idea of how to inform our own designs.</p>
                                <p style="padding-left: 20px">To this end I had decided to look at the SkyScanner bot on Skype. SkyScanner does flight and hotel room bookings and as a result would be similar to our gym booking system - both concentrating on booking certain places for the customer at a time that is available. Below you can see how the interaction with the bot unfolded. </p></br>
                                <div class="well">
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">When a user first enters the bot interface, they will be met with a welcome message and a few prompts to get them started. Here we have the option to see an example of booking a flight to help the user get to know how to use the system. For first time users they are prompted whether they wish to set certain places as default locations to provide a more smooth user journey for subsequent journeys.</p></br>

                                    <center><img src="img/skyscannerexample.PNG" style="width:800px"></center></br>

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px">After this, we have then decided to actually book a flight. For this we are prompted for our destination, where we intentionally made a typo in the response to see if the bot could deal with that. In the end it had managed to understand we meant New York and after further prompts for date and starting location as well as other options gave us some options to pick from (presented in the form of cards). It took around 10 seconds for the bot to query our search and return the results and each result had the option to book, see the cheapest options and set a price alert. If you were to click "book" it would then redirect you to the SkyScanner website to complete the bookings from the options shown there. If you were to click "show cheapest options", it would show the cheapest 5 flights in the bot itself in the form of more cards where you had the option to book, again redirecting you if you were to click "book".</p></br>

The user selects one of the boxes and until he books a gym class. The conversation with the bot can now end.</p>

                                  A digital assistant, also called a virtual assistant, is an application program that can understand natural language and complete electronic tasks for the end user.
                                  Such tasks, which might have been performed by a personal assistant or secretary in previous decades, include taking dictation, reading text or email messages aloud, looking up phone numbers, anticipating requests, placing calls and reminding the end user about appointments. Popular digital assistants currently include Apple's  Siri, Google Now and Cortana, the digital assistant built into Windows Phone 8.1.
                                  Today's digital assistants are programmed with artificial intelligence, machine learning and voice recognition technology. As the end user interacts with his digital assistant, the AI programming uses sophisticated algorithms to learn from data input and become better at predicting the end user's needs. Tomorrow's digital assistants will be built with more advanced cognitive computing technologies which will allow a digital assistant to understand and carry out multi-step requests and perform more complex tasks such as making a plane reservation.

As an app Cortana does function slightly more slowly as it does not have as much low-level access as digital assistants on their native devices however it works satisfactorily. The main cause for this is developer restrictions on IOS and Android devices.

                                    The List Skill API has a bi-directional interface that ensures lists are updated across all channels. That means the API notifies developers when a customer tells Alexa to add something to their list or makes a change to an existing item. Alexa understands the user’s speech request, converts it to a To-do, and sends you a notification with the new item that was added to the list. The List Skill API also updates the lists for Alexa when users make changes to their lists online or in your mobile application. We could apply this to the gym booking request, user adds book a gym class to his/her To-do list or user adds he/she has to attend the gym on a specific day and then Alexa sends a notification to the user’s phone. On the day of gym class, when user asks Alexa what’s on my To-do list, Alexa would remind him/her of going to the gym today.
                                    Alexa List Skill API is available now but in limited participation beta.

                                    By using Alexa skills, we can engage voice interaction for getting a reminder from Alexa on the day of the gym class.
                                    Alexa has a skill which is called Calendar Reader, if we could sync the user calendar with Alexa, we would be able to get updates on the events in our case the gym class everyday, by asking Alexa what events are happening today? Tell me more about this event Alexa.
                                    Of course this is only possible when we build a bot which is able to add the gym class to user’s calendar immediately after user has booked the class.

                                    This feature, which allows customers to easily link their accounts with an existing account or service. Account linking allows our skill to securely authenticate a user with popular websites and services like Twitter, Facebook, and many others. Once the user has granted your skill access to the external account, the skill can perform operations with that account on behalf of the user. In our use case, user can log in to his/her Facebook, Skype, Slack account to be able to send messages to the chat bot for booking a gym class or being informed on the gym classes available.
                                    The main problem is how are we going to do the authentication so that the user can easily use his/her accounts on different services.
