                    <p>Many people are now very busy and lead lives on the go and often are on their mobile devices. For them making bookings can be a hassle and time consuming so
                    we are trying to find a way to make this process more interactive and much faster for the customers.</p>
                    <p>We had met with Alex Matei from Nuffield and have worked closely with representatives from Microsoft such as Paul Thomas in order to develop our
                    chatbot and digital assitant to try address this problem.</p>
                    <p>Fuller details on the problem statement and solution are given below.</p>

                            <p class="lead">The project will then continue as we will try to integrate a digital assistant so rather than type, a user will be able to speak to the bot - to achieve this, we will be using digital assistant services such as Cortana or Siri.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The end product will be a bot which allows for customers to better interact with the company and any bookings they wish to make. It is worth noting this would be an alternative to using the website (where bookings have just gone live) or call the centres in order to book sessions and is one of the key motivations behind why this project is being undertaken.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Most people are usually busy and booking appointments by taking time out to traverse a website or call in to a reception desk is a time consuming task. Nuffiled Health wants to address this issue with their bot as it would allow the clients of Nuffield Centres to interact much more easily with the company. As a result, the clients will be able to book gym sessions or use other services much more easily. One of the gains would be that staff will not have to keep taking as many calls to deal with booking queries since the clients can book and also check or cancel appoitments from the devices. Our challenge would be to find an effective way to encapsulate the different queries and tasks a user may wish to undertake with this bot into a design that facilitates this easier interaction between Nuffield and the clients. </p>
                            <p class="lead">The bot will enable Nuffield to cater for more ways through which customers can book appointments by expanding the online booking service - which increases reach and accessibilty</p>
                            <p class="lead">Reduce the number of missed bookings by reminding people beforehand and also offering the option to cancel.</p>

This then needs to be supplemented with a digital assistant that is flexible enough to parse user speech and works for commands which is fair to be expected from normal usage and is not rigid in the inputs it can take. Putting these together would give us a deliverable which the client had outlined in the brief and would be considered a success.</p>

We are using Node.js to create a Wrapper API around the existing backhand to make it fit the requirements of the AI user interaction text. On top of this wrapper, we are going to have our digital assistant or chat bot written in the language of the (framework we will use). The exchange of data is done using a RESTFUL approach.</p>

            <p class="lead">
            <p>For gathering more specific requirements, we interviewed some of the Nuffield Health Center clients, this resulted to the personas and scenarios we made which then made us to go back to our requirements and add some features to it and refine it accordingly.
                The new requirements included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Getting users' feedback after attending the gym through the bot</li>
                <li>Being able to tell the user where the closest Nuffield gym is through both bot and digital assistant</li>
                <li>Sending reminders to the users prior to their gym class through both chat bot and digital assistant</li>
            </ol>

            <p> THe interviews were semi- structured, with some questions considered as vital being asked of everybody and other questions were more opinion based and left open-ended.
            Once the interviews had been conducted the results were collated and analysed to pick out what mattered the most to users and also what we had presumed was important but turned out not to be.
            The analysis was done formally as the set questions were on a scale of 1-10 and this made it easy to compare between responses while for the open ended questions a list of key requirements were
            written out for each response.</p>

                                            <p>Professor Nodoka is a humanities professor for a college in the south of London. She is 60 years old and has just started going to the gym a few month ago. She does not use her phone a lot because she thinks technology is not for her. She likes to go the gym on a regular basis but often cannot attend classes because they are fully booked. She is very organised and likes her days to be planned out in advance so she can know what she is doing. She lives a bit far from the gym. She likes her job a lot and definitely not thinking about retiring.</p>

                                            <p>Gabriella is a student at University of East London. She is quite overweight and was convinced by mother to join the gym. She spends most her days on her phone at home texting friends. She is very present on social media and has very active social media profiles. She does not really like to try new technology tools unless they are buzzing and extremely simple to use. She is not particularly interesting in how quickly something goes it just has to be simple to use. She does not really like physically activity and wants her experience before going to classes to be motivating.</p>

                <p class="lead">After discussing the project with Nuffield Health Center as our client, in the first stage, we came up with a set of requirements considering the general users of Nuffield Gym. Their problem was that some people found it hard and time consuming to open their laptop and go through the website and do the gym class booking, hence they would stop going to the gym easily. They wanted to solve this issue by using bots and digital assistants and providing the booking functionality as well as sending reminders to them to stop them from quitting the gym.</p>
