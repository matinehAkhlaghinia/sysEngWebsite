                        Due to the number of people involved in this project and the number of tasks we were all undertaking, it was very important to have dedicated communication channels so that not only the team could stay in touch but also the TA and supervisor for this project. Below we outline the methods we used for communication and collaboration between the team members.


                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-xs-1">

                            <div class="col-xs-11">
                                <h3>Team 31</h3>
                                <p>Our sister team was Team 31 with whom we had regular meetings to discuss the architecture and also when we were speaking to the representatives from Microsoft. This has added a layer of complexity to the project in that we had to make sure our plans for communications within the architecture model alligned with each other. </p>

                                <h3>Slack</h3>
                                <p>Our primary mode of communication between our supervisor, the client, our TA and fellow team members was slack. We used this service to not only communicate for general needs but also created separate channels in order to break the discussions down into their relevant topics. This made our discussions more efficient and the ability to share and pin files also made it easier to keep track of documents without needing to access our Google Drive storage. It also allowed us to to communicate with our sister team on this project as certain aspects of our project overlapped with theirs.</p>

                                <p>For this project along with our Github repositories for code, we also needed a place to keep track of our written documents such as biweekly reports and research undertaken. Google Docs provided the easiest way for us to store and access these files from a centralised area while also being able to edit documents in google docs itself - also allowing us to all work on files at the same time is a useful feature.</p>

                                <p>We used Github over the course of this project in order to keep track of two main areas - our website and our project code. All members made regular commits as they completed their assigned tasks and it allowed us to easy make updates to our work and add in new features. We would also be able to share this repository with the client in order to show him the progress being made and so we would be able to ask for feedback.</p>

                                <p>While the other tools we have used have been useful to communicate and organise our work, we did not want the tasks to be drowned out in the discussions and we did not want to have to put it in a document as this felt rather cumbersome. As a result we decided to use Trello, as it made it easy to assign tasks to people, see the breakdown of the tasks and what categories they belonged to as well as being able to set reminders on the task. This proved a much better way to organise tasks todo than using a document. </p>

                                <p>Due to the number of people involved on this project from UCL's side, Microsoft's side and Nuffield's side - it invariably meant that due to tight schedules it would be hard to find a time where everyone would be able to meet in person. As a result we undertook a fair few meetings via Skype calls to make it easier for everyone involved. </p>

                                <p>Since Microsoft was a partner with us in this project, we were able to use some of their tools to aid us. This particular tool was very similar to trello and we used this over Trello when we need to deal with breaking up major tasks into sub tasks as it was more efficient and allowed us to keep Trello for general purpose uses.</p>

                        <p class="well">
                            The app.js is the server where the bot lives there. So when the user starts the chat with the bot as long as
                            there's no need for the bot to interact with the API wrapper, the interaction is limited to the interface user is dealing with
                            and the bot server. For example when the user asks about the closest nuffield gym.

                        <p class="well">
                            We are going to make our own API Wrapper upon Nuffield's API to get the data that we need,
                            which is basically viewing the classes available in a specific Nuffield gym, booking a gym class providing the parameters
                            like date, time and type of a class or canceling a certain booking.
                        <p>

                        <p class="well">
                            Whenever the user wants to book a class, cancel a class, give feedback or view a list of bookings, bot server sends a request
                            depending on user's demand and comes back to the user with confirmation or failure response.
                        <p>
                        <h4 class="lead">Bot Server and Messaging Queue Interaction</h4>
                        <p class="well">
                            As we are collaborating with Team 31, after the bookings, cancelations and feedbacks, the data would be sent
                            to their messaging queue for organizations to be able to access the data and do analysation on it.
