                <h2 class="section-heading">Plans for term 2</h2>
                <p class="lead">The team had finalised the requirements for this project as well as the architecture that would be used coming into the second phase of this project, which would be implementation of our requirements into the final application. We will approach these requirements in the same order as they have been presented in our MoSCow analysis - this involved starting with the backend, then frontend and then integration of the two components into one independent, discrete module. </p>
                <p class="lead">Our team has been using a Scrum agile approach to our development process along with several client meetings throughout each fortnight, this will be something we will continue as it will be beneficial to adopt this during the more technical phase. It also allows us for regular testing during each iteration of the project which will help will quality assurance of the final software product. This will enable us to gain feedback from the client as well during each iteration and we can accordingly adjust to any feedback or changes that need to be made during the sprint.</p>
                <p class="lead">Should the team manage to complete the "would" and "should" have requirements ahead of schedule, we will then try and complete some of the optional requirements what we "could" have. The other area we will then look at is the user experience and see if there are any enchancements that can be made having tried our final product. The current focus so far during this project has been the functional aspects of the software product as there are many parts to this and all of these parts must be integrated.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Testing Strategy</h2>
				<p class="lead"> For testing our API we conducted research on different testing frameworks that are available- we then whittled this down to two choices Mocha and Chai. Mocha provides various features we could use to test of bot.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-11">
                        <h3>Mocha: Testing Environment</h3>
                        <p>Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serialy, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to correct test cases.</p>
						<p>Mocha comes with tons of great features such as:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Simple async support, including promises</li>
							<li>Async test timeout support</li>
							<li>Before, after, before each, after each hooks (very useful to clean the environment where each test!).</li>
						</ul>

                    </div>
					<p>
					  So with Mocha we have our testing environment for making our tests but for being able to test the HTTP calls, for example testing if a certain GET request returns the expected JSON file, we need
					  an assertion library.
					</p>
                    <div class="col-xs-11">
                        <h3>Chai: Assertion Library</h3>
                        <p>While the other tools we have used have been useful to communicate and organise our work, we did not want the tasks to be drowned out in the discussions and we did not want to have to put it in a document as this felt rather cumbersome. As a result we decided to use Trello, as it made it easy to assign tasks to people, see the breakdown of the tasks and what categories they belonged to as well as being able to set reminders on the task. This proved a much better way to organise tasks todo than using a document. </p>
