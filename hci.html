                <p>About:</p>
                <p>Professor Nodoka is a humanities professor for a college in the south of London. She is 60 years old and has just started going to the gym a few month ago. She does not use her phone a lot because she thinks technology is not for her. She likes to go the gym on a regular basis but often cannot attend classes because they are fully booked. She is very organised and likes her days to be planned out in advance so she can know what she is doing. She lives a bit far from the gym. She likes her job a lot and definitely not thinking about retiring.</p>
                <p>Motivations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change her ways with technologies</li>

                    <li>Book gym classes quickly and get reminders when she has to go and on her calendar.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pain Points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She is not active on social media platforms and has very little technology at home</li>
                    <li>She likes things to be done quickly and does not want to waste too much time having to go on her phone to book a gym class.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Behaviour:</p>
