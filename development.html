                We had conducted a vast amount of research before settling on the technologies we would be using for this project. Here is the final specification of the of the technologies we used and why the justifications and reasoning behind the choices made for their inclusion.

                Due to the number of people involved in this project and the number of tasks we were all undertaking, it was very important to have dedicated communication channels so that not only the team could stay in touch but also the TA and supervisor for this project. Below we outline the methods we used for communication and collaboration between the team members.

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-1">

                    <div class="col-xs-11">
                <h3>Slack</h3>
                <p>Our primary mode of communication between our supervisor, the client, our TA and fellow team members was slack. We used this service to not only communicate for general needs but also created separate channels in order to break the discussions down into their relevant topics. This made our discussions more efficient and the ability to share and pin files also made it easier to keep track of documents without needing to access our Google Drive storage. It also allowed us to to communicate with our sister team on this project as certain aspects of our project overlapped with theirs.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-11">
                        <h3>Google Drive</h3>
                        <p>For this project along with our Github repositories for code, we also needed a place to keep track of our written documents such as biweekly reports and research undertaken. Google Docs provided the easiest way for us to store and access these files from a centralised area while also being able to edit documents in google docs itself - also allowing us to all work on files at the same time is a useful feature.</p>

                        <h3>Github</h3>
                        <p>We used Github over the course of this project in order to keep track of two main areas - our website and our project code. All members made regular commits as they completed their assigned tasks and it allowed us to easy make updates to our work and add in new features. We would also be able to share this repository with the client in order to show him the progress being made and so we would be able to ask for feedback.</p>

                <p>Over the course of the project we had held numerous meetings each week in order to make sure we were on track with our work and also to make sure we were making progress as per our timeline. While these meeting minutes can also be found in the biweekly reports, they are all listed here for convenience. </p>
