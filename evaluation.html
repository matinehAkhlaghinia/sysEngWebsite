                <ol>
                    <li>Integration with existing API<br>-another API for this project was being created at the time where we joined in, meaning we would have to adapt and learn how the current
                    one was being used. We had looked over it and discussed with the creator how it worked to understand it in its entirety. </li>
                    <br><li>Integration with sister Team 31<br>-for this project we had to work with Team 31 as the projects were related, this added a layer of complexity to both teams. To solve this
                    we synchronised our work with Team 31 and kept them informed about our changed and when we made an important change that affected them or required their backend - we would
                    work together to avoid conflict of work.</li>
                    <br><li>Natural Language Processing<br>-since the user would be at liberty to say whatever they wish to the bot or digital assistant it would be vital to
                find our what their intent would be from a variety of ways to express this. To overcome this complex task we used LUIS to train responses to give the correct intent from a given phrase.</li>
                    <br><li>Team Management<br>-the team had many separate tasks to work on but would also need to come together as a lot of different parts intertwined - this was solved by good
                team management and communication.</li>

                    <td>Since the final products were a chatbot and a digital assistant - this limited a lot of the options in terms of what we could focus on in order to improve the UI and UX.
                    As a result we looked at what areas could be improved and really focused on making these the best they could be.
                    <br><br>
                    For the UI we had decided to use cards for the bots - this made the design much more visually appealing and made navigating the app more interesting yet also easier. The cards
                        also allowed us to add functionalities such as booking in a much more convenient manner.
                    <br><br>
                        For the UX we spent a lot of time designing the user journey through the app and trying to get a user from the beginning of their conversation to the end of the conversation
                        as quickly as possible. At the same time looked at how to make the transitions between reply and response as intuitive as possible so that a user would not be surprised
                        or confused by a response to their query.

                    utterances that would have to be made. As a lot of time has been spent reviewing user journeys - it has meant that as of now, the bot and digital assistant are both very good at

                    and the changes will be automatically deployed across the various platforms. For more features to be added to the bot the Node code can be edited and tested - this makes it very easy to maintain the bot. The digital assistant is also centralised in Amazon's Developer site
                    and as a result changes (e.g. a new feature) are very easy to implement. </td>

                        <b>User testing - </b> as our bot would be used with a very wide audience, which could range from young teens to people in their old
                        age, it was vital that the application would work for all demographics and would be as usable for one particular audience as well as another. For this we had made sure that the user
                        would test all aspects of the app, from booking, viewing and cancelling a class to being able to go back and forth within an app with ease. These test had confirmed
                        that our initial flow design and application designs had been fruitful as every user was able to use the application with ease. To keep this testing fair, we made sure
                        that the demographic range of our users matches that of the end user audience. <br><br>

                    All the work was centralised in one repository meaning that all members had instant access and could make their changes when they wished and could share files as they completed them
                    and other team members could make sure progress was all up-to-date.</td>

                <li>Ability to modify a booking instead of having to cancel and re-book the class</li>
