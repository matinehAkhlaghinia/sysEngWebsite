                                <p class="lead">The project will then continue as we will try to integrate a digital assistant so rather than type, a user will be able to speak to the bot - to achieve this, we will be using digital assistant services such as Cortana or Siri.</p>
                                <p class="lead">The end product will be a bot which allows for customers to better interact with the company and any bookings they wish to make. This would be beneficial for the company as users don't have to go through the website or call the centres in order to book sessions and is one of the key motivations behind why this project is being undertaken.</p>

                                <p class="lead">Most people are usually busy and booking appointments by taking time out to traverse a website or call in to a reception desk is a time consuming task. Nuffiled Health wants to address this issue with their bot as it would allow the clients of Nuffield Centres to interact much more easily with the company. As a result, the clients will be able to book gym sessions or use other services much more easily. One of the gains would be that staff will not have to keep taking as many calls to deal with booking queries since the clients can book and also check or cancel appoitments from the devices. Our challenge would be to find an effective way to encapsulate the different queries and tasks a user may wish to undertake with this bot into a design that facilitates this easier interaction between Nuffield and the clients. </p>
                                <p class="lead">Another frequent problem that Nuffield has which is characteristic of all gyms, is when users leave - our bot would need to be able to send push notifications whenever we predict someone may be about to leave the gym based on their usage patterns.</p>

This then needs to be supplemented with a digital assistant that is flexible enough to parse user speech and works for commands which is fair to be expected from normal usage and is not rigid in the inputs it can take. Putting these together would give us a deliverable which the client had outlined in the brief and would be considered a success.</p>

We are using Node.js to create a Wrapper API around the existing backhand to make it fit the requirements of the AI user interaction text. On top of this wrapper, we are going to have our digital assistant or chat bot written in the language of the (framework we will use). The exchange of data is done using a RESTFUL approach.</p>
